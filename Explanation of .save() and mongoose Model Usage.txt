Short Explanation of .save() and Mongoose Model Usage: 

A Mongoose model is a JavaScript representation of a MongoDB collection. It provides an interface to create, read, update, and delete documents in the database. 

When we create a new instance of a model, we are essentially creating a new document. 

The .save() method is used to insert that document into the MongoDB database.
